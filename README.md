# UEFN-AI-Room-System

A simplified room progression system used in Fortnite islands. You could say it’s a continuation of the wave system I used in https://github.com/stazzalopez/UEFN-AI-Wave-System
. I used both codes together, but anyone using it can easily adjust, add, or remove what they need.
